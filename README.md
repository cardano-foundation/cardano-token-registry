# cardano-token-registry

##  Background
This repository provides a means to register off-chain token metadata that can map to on-chain identifiers (typically hashes representing asset IDs, output locking scripts, or token forging policies).

A [server](#server) exposes the functionality of a key-value store, allowing users and applications to query registry entries through a RESTful API.

While this registry is limited in scope to handle native tokens only, it will also serve to facilitate a discussion and introduce a standard for a metadata distribution system that is currently put forward as a [draft CIP](https://github.com/michaelpj/CIPs/blob/cip-metadata-server/cip-metadata-server.md).

Use of this registry is subject to the [Registry Terms of Use](Registry_Terms_of_Use.md).           
Use of the public API is subject to the [API Terms of Use](API_Terms_of_Use.md).

## Process

#### New registration

New submissions to this registry will take the form of a GitHub Pull Request with the addition of one JSON file to the [mappings/](mappings) folder. Submissions will be subject to automated checking for well-formedness and human vetting before being merged to the registry.


#### Updating existing entries

Modification of entries in this registry will take the form of a GitHub Pull Request with the modification of one or more JSON files in the [mappings/](mappings) folder. Submissions will be subject to automated checking for well-formedness and human vetting before being merged to the registry.

`policy`         | Required  | The script that hashes to the policyId
`name`           | Required  | A human-readable name for the subject, suitable for use in an interface
`description`    | Required  | A human-readable description for the subject, suitable for use in an interface
