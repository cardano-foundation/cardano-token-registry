Built on humor and unity, HOSKDOG celebrates the legacy of Hosky while marking a new era of decentralized participation.\n\nMore than a meme, HOSKDOG represents loyalty, energy, and collective creativity. Every HKDG token is a pawprint of progress — a reminder that decentralization thrives when it’s fun, inclusive, and human.\n\nHOSKDOG runs with the pack of creators, traders, and builders who believe in a future led by transparency, freedom, and community-first values. No leash, no limits — just pure Cardano energy.",
