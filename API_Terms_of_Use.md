# Cardano Registry API Terms of Use # 

## Preamble ##

- The Cardano Stiftung is a Swiss non-profit foundation, domiciled at Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland (the **“Foundation”** or **“we”**). The Foundation owns, operates and makes available the **“Cardano Registry”**, an online utility that allows the public to access information on identifiers used in the Cardano network, which is governed by the **“Cardano Registry’s Terms of Use”** as available under [Terms of Use for Cardano Registry](Registry_Terms_of_Use.md). The Cardano Registry may be accessed through an API providing read-only access to fetch information from the Cardano Registry (the **“API”**). 

- You (the **“User”**) want to use the API to access and retrieve information from the Cardano Registry.

- These API Terms of Use (the **“Terms”**) set out the terms under which the User may access and use the API. Please read these Terms carefully, as they constitute a legally binding agreement between the User and the Foundation.

## Scope and Applicability ##

- By using or accessing the API, the User agrees to comply with and be bound by these Terms and the provisions herein without reservations.

- The User may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if the User is not of legal age to form a binding contract with the Foundation.

- The use of the API is free of charge. It is the User’s responsibility to make any and all arrangements necessary in order to use the API.

- If the User is using the APIs on behalf of an entity, the User represents and warrants that she or he has authority to bind that entity to these Terms and by accepting these Terms, the User is doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to the User in these Terms refer to that entity).


## Use of the API ##

Subject to these Terms and the following conditions, the API may be used for personal and/or commercial purposes without restriction:

- The use must be in compliance with these Terms and the Cardano Registry’s Terms of Use;

- the User must comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws); 

- the User must only access (or attempt to access) the API by the means described in the documentation of the API;

- the User must not use the APIs to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights;

- the User must not access the API in any manner that (1) compromises, breaks or circumvents any technical processes or security measures associated with the API, (2) poses a security vulnerability to the Foundation, other users of the API or other third-parties, or (3) test the vulnerability of the API or its underlying systems or networks;

- attempt to use the API in a manner that exceeds limits, or constitutes excessive or abusive usage;

- if the User offers the application using the API for use by third parties (**“End Users”**), the User must maintain a service agreement and privacy policy applicable to the relationship between the User and the End User, whereas these agreements must be in accordance and in full compliance of the applicable laws and regulations and must include the Cardano Registry’s Terms of Use by reference;

- the owner of trade names, trademarks, service marks, product names or otherwise protected or proprietary names or content included in the information contained in the Cardano Registry has given prior permission to the intended use;

- all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices contained in the information of the Cardano Registry must be retained.


## API License ##

- Subject to these Terms, the Foundation grants to the User a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, worldwide, and revocable license to use and access the API and respective documentation to the extent necessary for the User to develop, test, and support the integration of the User’s application (the **“License”**).

- The License to use the Cardano Registry’s API is conditional on the User’s compliance with these Terms and the Cardano Registry’s Terms of Use; any violation of either of these terms will automatically terminate the License.

- Some of the software included in the API is offered under an open source license. An open source software license constitutes a separate written agreement. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement for the applicable open source software.


## API Restrictions and Limitations ##

- The Foundation sets and enforces limits on the User’s use of the API (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that may be made or the number of End Users the User may serve), in its own sole discretion.

- The User agrees to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations for the use of the API. 

- The information made accessible through the API is subject to Cardano Registry’s Terms of Use and subject to the Foundation’s sole discretion as stated therein. If deemed necessary by the Foundation, the information made accessible through the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered (e.g. to ensure compliance with applicable law, regulation, or other terms).


## Changes to the API ##

- The Foundation reserves the right to make changes or updates to the API at any time without further notice at its own sole discretion.

- The User acknowledges that changes or updates to the API may require the User to make modifications to the application using the API in order to ensure continuous proper functioning. Such modifications are at the User’s sole cost and expense.


## Intellectual Property Provisions ##

- The entirety of the API and the Cardano Registry, including its structure, documentation and otherwise accessible content, is protected by copyright, trademark, or other applicable intellectual property rights. Other than explicitly stated in these Terms, all such intellectual property rights are and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Foundation.

- Other than explicitly stated in these Terms, the API, the Cardano Registry and the information contained in the Cardano Registry must not be reproduced, copied, distributed, sold or rented, sublicensed, stored, or in any other manner re-used without the prior explicit written consent of the Foundation.

- The Foundation does not acquire ownership in the User’s application, and by using and accessing the API, the User does not acquire ownership of any rights in the API, any of its documentation, or the information that is accessed through the API.

- If the User provides feedback or suggestions about the API, then the Foundation may use such information without obligation to the User.

- In the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the API, the Foundation may use the User’s company or product name. The User grants to the Foundation all necessary rights for these purposes.


## Security and Audit ##

- The User agrees that the Foundation may monitor the use of the API to ensure quality, improve its products and services, and verify the User’s compliance with these Terms.

- The Foundation reserves the right to audit, or to appoint an independent auditor under appropriate non-disclosure conditions to audit User’s application, systems and records to confirm the User’s compliance with these Terms.

- The User agrees to cooperate with inquiries related to such an audit and provide the Foundation with proof that the application complies with these Terms.

- The User must use commercially reasonable efforts to protect third party information accessed through the API from unauthorized access or use and must promptly report any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations.
